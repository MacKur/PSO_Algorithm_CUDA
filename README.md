# PSO_Algorithm_CUDA
A project aimed at implementing the PSO algorithm in C++ to optimize benchmark mathematical functions in two ways for the purpose of comparing them: using the CPU and GPU.
Program allows to check the difference between processing calculations using CPU vs GPU on four different benchmark mathematical functions: Rosenbrock function (by default), Ackleys function, Sphere function, Rastrigin function.


## Sample program result (using Rosenbrock function)
